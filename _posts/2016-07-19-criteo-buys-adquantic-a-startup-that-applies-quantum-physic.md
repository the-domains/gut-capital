  We have discovered that Criteo, the French ad tech company that raised $250
  million in an IPO on NASDAQ last October, has quietly made an acquisition.
  It's bought AdQuantic, another ad tech startup from France, this one
  co-founded by two doctors of statistical physics, which has developed a bid
  management tool for search marketing based on game theory, quantum physics and
  related mathematical models.
